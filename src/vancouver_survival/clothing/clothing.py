    """
    Calculate how much warmth you need to survive your campus commute! 🧥❄️
    
    Because nobody wants to be that student shivering at the bus stop while
    pretending to look at their phone. This function helps you figure out 
    just how many layers you need to stay cozy on your way to that 8am lecture
    you're already regretting.
    
    Args:
        temp_celsius (float): The temperature outside (in Celsius, because we're civilized)
        wind_speed_kmh (float): How angry the wind is today (in km/h)
        is_waiting_for_bus (bool): Are you standing still getting frozen, or actively moving?
    
    Returns:
        A warmth score that tells you how bundled up you need to be!
        (Implementation coming soon - for now, just stay warm! ☕)
