def calculate_warmth_score(temp_celsius, wind_speed_kmh, is_waiting_for_bus):
    """
    Calculate a warmth score to determine appropriate clothing for Vancouver campus commute.
    
    The score increases with colder conditions, accounting for temperature, wind chill,
    and whether you're stationary or moving. Higher scores indicate colder perceived
    conditions requiring more insulation.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    temp_celsius : float
        Temperature in Celsius. Must be >= -273.15 (absolute zero).
    wind_speed_kmh : float
        Wind speed in kilometers per hour. Must be non-negative.
    is_waiting_for_bus : bool
        True if wait for a bus expected (increases warmth score by 2 because of inactivity), 
        False if actively walking/biking.
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        Warmth score indicating clothing needs, for example:
        + 1: T-shirt weather (>10°C after wind chill)
        + 3: Light jacket (0-10°C after wind chill)
        + 10: Arctic parka (<-20°C after wind chill)
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If wind_speed_kmh is negative (physics violation).
        If temp_celsius is below -273.15 (below absolute zero).
    
    Notes
    -----
    Wind chill reduces effective temperature by 1°C per 10 km/h of wind.
